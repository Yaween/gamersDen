			<!--Description of the sport.-->
			<p> Video game competitions are known as esports, or electronic sports. Esports frequently take the shape of planned, 
				competitive multiplayer video games, especially involving professional players, either individually or in teams.
				 While though organized tournaments have always been a part of the video gaming culture, these were primarily amateur 
				 contests up until the late 2000s, when professional gamers began to participate and live streaming of these events experienced a significant 
				 increase in popularity. Esports has become a substantial part of the video game industry by the 2010s, with many game developers actively creating
				  and financing tournaments and other events.<p>
